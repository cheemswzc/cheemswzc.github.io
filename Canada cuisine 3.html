&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ginger ale is a carbonated soft drink flavored with ginger. It is consumed on its own or used as a mixer, often with spirit-based drinks. There are two main types of ginger ale. The golden style is credited to the Irish doctor Thomas Joseph Cantrell. The dry style (also called the pale style), a paler drink with a much milder ginger flavor, was created by Canadian John McLaughlin.

<h2 style="color:whitesmoke;">History</h2>
<h4>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thomas Joseph Cantrell, an Irish apothecary and surgeon, manufactured the first ginger ale in Belfast, Northern Ireland in the 1850s. This was the older golden style fermented ginger ale, dark coloured, generally sweet to taste, with a strong ginger spice flavor, which he marketed through local beverage manufacturer Grattan and Company. Grattan embossed the slogan "The Original Makers of Ginger Ale" on its bottles. Ginger ale is transparent, whereas ginger beer, a stronger tasting product, is often cloudy due to the residues of brewing.

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dry ginger ale was created by Canadian John J. McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavor extracts to add to the water in 1904. That year, he introduced "Pale Dry Ginger Ale", the bubbly drink that would be patented in 1907 as "Canada Dry Ginger Ale". A success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages.

<h2 style="color:whitesmoke">Definitions</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><h3 style="color: black; text-align: left;">
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Traditional ginger ale is fermented from a microbial starter culture (yeast or ginger bug), sugar, fresh ginger root, other flavorings and water. Ginger bug can be derived from ginger beer plant containing Saccharomyces florentinus and Lactobacillus hilgardii or fresh ginger root containing Lactobacillus bacteria and wild yeast. The carbonation comes from the yeast fermentation as opposed to carbonating the finished product. Ethanol, as a byproduct of fermentation, will be present in the ginger ale but can be controlled by modifying fermentation time.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Commercial ginger ale commonly contains carbonated water, sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial or natural ginger-flavor. Ginger content is often listed on labels in a general "natural aroma" or "natural flavoring" statement, to preserve secrecy of the complex proprietary mix of spices, fruits and other flavors used;[citation needed] lemon, lime, and cane sugar are the most common ingredients.[citation needed] Pineapple and honey are also occasionally used.

<h2 style="color:whitesmoke;">Origins</h2>
<h3>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The sparkling, spicy treats known as ginger beer began with ginger beer, a Victorian alcoholic beverage invented in Yorkshire, England. The first ginger beer was created in Ireland around 1851. This ginger beer is a non-alcoholic soft drink. Carbonation is done by adding carbon dioxide.</h3>

      <h3 style="color: black; text-align: left;">
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In 1907, John McLaughlin, a Canadian pharmacist, invented the modern Canadian dried ginger juice.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;McLaughlin graduated from the University of Toronto in 1885 with a gold medal in Pharmacy. By 1890, John McLaughlin had opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto, Canada. He sells his products to local pharmacies, which use carbonated water mixed with juices and condiments to create tasty sodas that they sell to their soda fountain customers.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;John McLaughlin started making his own recipes for fizzy drinks in 1890 and created McLaughlin Belfast Ginger Beer. McLaughlin also developed a method of bottling ginger beer in large quantities, which led to successful sales. Each bottle of MacLaurin Belfast ginger Ale features a map of Canada and a picture of the beaver (Canada's national animal) on the label.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By 1907, John McLauglin had improved his recipe by toning down the black and improving the taste of his first ginger beer. The result is John McLaughlin's patented Canadian Dry Pale ginger ale. On May 16, 1922, "Canadian Dry" ginger beer was registered as a trademark.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"Ginger beer champagne" is another famous Canadian dry trademark. This "pale" style of ginger beer made a good, delicious alternative to club soda, especially during America's Prohibition era, when ginger beer's spices masked the imperfections of illegal alcoholic spirits.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dried ginger beer can be used as a soft drink and as a mixer for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. It is also commonly used to combat stomach upset. Ginger has been shown to benefit digestion for centuries, and scientific studies have shown that ginger beer can help fight nausea.
