        <p>As for clicking any place on the screen and popping up the warning box, it may be my technical problem that I cannot achieve.I did a lot of research on the Internet and I asked some seniors and some teachers. They say clicking on the screen to capture the underlying events of the system may require C.The only way to do that would be to write a fake, transparent program, trick the user, and then launch the program and capture the customer click.（Or maybe I was distracted in class and didn't understand the question.）</p >
