&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Canadian cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices of Canada, and often varies depending on the region of the nation.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;First Nations and Inuit peoples have practiced their own culinary traditions in what is now Canada since time immemorial. The advent of European explorers and settlers, first on the east coast and then throughout the wider territories of New France, British North America and Canada, saw to the melding of foreign recipes, cooking techniques, and ingredients with indigenous flora and fauna. Modern Canadian cuisine has maintained this dedication to local ingredients and terroir, as exemplified in the naming of specific ingredients based on their locale, such as Digby scallops, Pacific smoked salmon, Alberta-raised beef, Malpeque oysters, Brome Lake duckling, or Winnipeg goldeye. Accordingly, Canadian cuisine privileges the quality of ingredients and regionality, and can be broadly defined as a national tradition of creole culinary practices, based on the complex multicultural and geographically diverse nature of both historical and contemporary Canadian society. There are many culinary practices and dishes that can be either identified as particular to Canada, such fish and brewis, peameal bacon, and ginger beef, or sharing an association with countries from which immigrants to Canada carried over their cuisine, such as pierogies, roast beef, and bannock.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Divisions within Canadian cuisine can be traced along regional lines and have a direct connection to the historical immigration patterns of each region or province. The earliest cuisines of Canada are based on Indigenous, English, Scottish and French roots. The traditional cuisines of both French Canada and English Canada have evolved from those carried over to North America from France and the British Isles respectively, and from their adaptation to Indigenous customs, labour-intensive and/or mobile lifestyles, and hostile environmental conditions. French Canadian cuisine can also be divided into Québécois cuisine and Acadian cuisine. Regional cuisines have continued to develop with subsequent waves of immigration during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, such as from Central Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and the Caribbean.

<h2 style="color:whitesmoke;">Definitions</h2>
<h3>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Although certain dishes may be identified as "Canadian" due to the ingredients used or the origin of their inception, an overarching style of Canadian cuisine may be more difficult to define. Some commentators, such as the former prime minister Joe Clark, believe Canadian cuisine to be a collage of dishes from a variety of cultures. Clark himself has been paraphrased to have noted that "Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord."</h3>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While the immense size of Canada, and the diversity of its inhabitants, compounds the difficulty in identifying a monolithic identity of Canadian culinary tradition, Hersch Jacobs acknowledges that the lack of a hegemonic definition does not preclude the existence of Canadian cuisine. Lenore Newman argues that there is a distinctly Canadian creole cuisine, and identifies five key properties that together define Canadian cuisine: its reliance on seasonality, multiculturalism, wild foods, regional dishes, and the privileging of ingredients over recipes.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Indigenous food may be considered uniquely Canadian, and the influence of Métis culture can be considered to have played a particularly important role in the origin of a distinct Canadian cuisine. Foods such as bannock, moose, deer, bison, pemmican, maple taffy, and Métis stews, such as barley stew, are all either traditional Indigenous foods, or originate from Canada with roots in Indigenous cuisines, and are eaten widely throughout the country.
        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There are many foods of foreign origin that are eaten commonly and considered integrated constituents of Canadian cuisine. Pierogies (dumplings of Central and Eastern European origin) are an example of this, due to the large number of early Ukrainian and Polish immigrants, while the ubiquity of roast beef and yorkshire pudding are an example of the heavy English influence. As demonstrated in the history and examples provided in the sections below, much of Canadian cuisine is coloured by the adaptation and development of dishes brought over to Canada by European, and later Asian, settlers. What's more, there is a variety of noteworthy Canadian variations on pre-established, templated food and drink, with their own nationally-defined particularities, such as Canadian cheddar cheese, whisky, bread, wine, bacon, and pancakes.

        <br>

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Some regional foods are not eaten as frequently in one part of the country as in the other, such as dulse in the Maritimes, stews in the Territories, smoked salmon in British Columbia, or poutine in the Francophone areas of Canada (not limited to Québec). In general, much of what is considered to be Canadian food contains a deal of starch, breads, game meats (such as deer, moose, bison, etc.), and often stews and soups, such as Métis-style and split-pea soup. Certain culinary traditions in Canada, such as the frying of dough, developed out of the country's historical (and contemporary) voyaging and frontier culture, have seen to both the creation of distinct national foods and the flourishing of a broader national association with certain types of dishes. In the case of frying dough, for example, particular foods originating form Canada would include beavertails, apple fritters and toutons, whilst foods such as doughnuts, bannock, bagels, and pancakes, though not physically originating from Canada, have none the less developed within a broader tradition of nationally-recognized cuisine.

    <th><h3 style="color: black; text-align: left;">
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The traditional Indigenous cuisine of Canada is based on a mixture of wild game, foraged foods, and farmed agricultural products. Each region of Canada, with its own First Nations and Inuit peoples, utilized local resources and distinct preparation techniques for their cuisines.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Maple syrup was first collected and used by the aboriginal people of Eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, and Canada remains the world's largest producer. Though the origin of maple syrup production is not clear, the earliest known syrups were made by repeatedly freezing the collected maple sap and removing the ice to concentrate the sugar in the remaining sap. Maple syrup is one of the most commonly consumed Canadian foods of Aboriginal origins.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dried meat products such as pânsâwân and pemmican are commonly consumed by the indigenous peoples of the plains. In particular, the former was a predecessor for North American-style beef jerky, with the processing methods adapted for beef.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In most of the Canadian West Coast and Pacific Northwest, Pacific salmon was an important food resource to the First Nations peoples, along with certain marine mammals. Salmon were consumed fresh during the spawning season, or smoked dry to create a jerky-like food that could be stored year-round. The latter food is commonly known and sold as "salmon jerky".

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whipped Soapberry, known as sxusem (sk-HOO-shum, "Indian ice cream") in the Interior Salish languages of British Columbia, is consumed similarly to ice cream or as a cranberry-cocktail-like drink. It is known for being a kidney tonic, which are called agutak in Arctic Canada (with animal/fish fat).

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the Arctic, Inuit traditionally survived on a diet consisting of land and marine mammals, fish, and foraged plant products. Meats were consumed fresh, but also often prepared, cached, and allowed to ferment into igunaq or kiviak. These fermented meats have the consistency and smell of certain soft aged cheeses. Snacks such as muktuk, which consist of whale skin and blubber is eaten plain, though occasionally dipped in soy sauce. Chunks of muktuk are sliced with an ulu prior to or during consumption.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fish are eaten boiled, fried, and prior to today's settlements, often in dried forms. The so-called "Eskimo potato", (Inuit: oak-kuk: Claytonia tuberosa) and other "mousefoods", are some of the plants consumed in the Arctic.

<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Foods such as "bannock", popular with First Nations and Inuit, reflect the historic exchange of these cultures with French fur traders, who brought with them new ingredients and foods. Common contemporary consumption of bannock, powdered milk, and bologna by aboriginal Canadians reflects the legacy of Canadian colonialism in the prohibition of hunting and fishing, and the institutional food rations provided to Indian reserves. Due to similarities in treatment under colonialism, many Native American communities throughout the continent consume similar food items, with some emphasis on local ingredients.
