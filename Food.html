                    <h1>POUTINE</h1>
                    <h5>A dish of french fries, cheese curds and gravy.</h5>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poutine is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec, in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec region, though its exact origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims regarding its invention. For many years it was mocked and used by some to stigmatize Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to popularity throughout the rest of Canada and in the northern United States.

                    <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual poutine celebrations occur in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville, as well as Toronto, Ottawa, New Hampshire, and Chicago. It has been called "Canada's national dish", though some believe this labelling represents cultural appropriation of the Québécois or Quebec's national identity. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches and dumplings.</p>

                    <h1>Butter tart</h1>
                    <h5>A type of small pastry tart</h5>
                    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:390px;"><img style="width:1030px;height:370px" src="https://lactantia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Butter-Tart-Cookies-copy_Header.png"></div>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A butter tart is a type of small pastry tart highly regarded in Canadian cuisine. The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg, baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart should not be confused with butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.

                    <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.

                    <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the English Canadian tart consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian sugar pie, or the base of the U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from the sugar pie given the lack of flour in the filling. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a "runnier" filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often raisins, walnuts, or pecans are added to the traditional butter tart, although the acceptability of such additions is a matter of national debate. As an iconic Canadian food and one of the most popular desserts in the country, the raisin-or-no-raisin question can provoke polarizing debate.

                    <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More exotic flavours are also produced by some bakers. Examples such as maple, bacon, pumpkin, chili, and salted caramel cardamom flavours have been made for competitions.</p>

                    <div class="fakeimg"><p>There are great regional variations in the Canadian diet. The origins of the Canadian diet are the Aboriginal diet, the English diet, the Scottish diet and the French diet. After the 20th century, with the increase of immigration from Central and Southern Europe, South and East Asia, and the Caribbean, the regional differences in the Canadian diet became more pronounced. The Canadian diet has been described as a hodgepodge.</p></div>
